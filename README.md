# Tspreed but without the "usleep is deprecated, and will be removed in near future!" warning.

**Note: NOT TESTED**

Why?

I wanted to get rid of the warning.

"warning: usleep is deprecated, and will be removed in near future!"

"warning: use "sleep 1e-06" instead..."

Fix:

Replace "usleep" with "sleep 1e-06".

tspreed is a terminal RSVP speed reader with Spritz-like functionality written in POSIX-compliant shell. It reads plain text from `stdin` and presents it one word at time.

If tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished, the progress of the presentation is passed to `stdout`.

#### Additional options

```
$ make help
```

## Usage

To use, pipe plain text into tspreed.

```
$ tspreed < textfile
```
```	
$ pdftotext document.pdf - | tspreed -w 300 -n 120 -s '\r\f' -lqihfb -p line -c 1
```

## Configuration

The values provided in the command options take precedence over the values provided in the local configuration file **`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/tspreed/tspreed.rc** (**~/.config/tspreed/tspreed.rc** if not defined), which takes precedence over the values provided in the global configuration file **/etc/tspreed/tspreed.rc**.

The default values are provided in [**./default.rc**](./default.rc), which is installed as the global configuration file.

| Option     | Configuration file   | Default value | Description |
| ---        | ---                  | ---           | ---         |
| -w `wpm`   | wpm=`wpm`            | 300           | Speed words are presented at in WPM (words per minute). Required to be set. Minimum value of 1, maximum value of 60000 |
| -n `num`   | numstart=`num`       |               | Start presenting from the *n*th word. Minimum value of 1. |
| -s `chars` | separators=`chars`   | \r\f          | Characters used for word splitting in addition to `$IFS`. Backslash escapes are interpreted. |
| -l         | lengthvary=`bool`    |               | Vary the speed words are presented at based on their length. |
| -q         | quietexit=`bool`     |               | Do not pass presentation progress to stdout if tspreed is terminated before the presentation has finished. |
| -h         | hidecursor=`bool`    | true          | Hide the cursor during the presentation. |
| -i         | proginfo=`bool`      |               | Display progress information during the presentation. |
| -f         | focus=`bool`         |               | Highlight the focus letter (also known as the pivot or optimal recognition point) of the word being presented. |
| -p `style` | focuspointer=`style` | line          | Display pointers in a given style pointing towards the focus letter. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. Styles: `none`, `line`, `point`. |
| -b         | focusbold=`bool`     | true          | Display the focus letter in bold. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. |
| -c `color` | focuscolor=`color`   | 1             | Display the focus letter in a given color. Only takes effect if focus letter highlighting is enabled. Values are [ANSI X3.64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) 8-bit color values, ranging from 0 to 255. |
| -v         |                      |               | Print tspreed version and exit. |

## Portability

tspreed 'officially' supports GNU-based, BSD-based, and BusyBox-based systems only due to POSIX-compliance issues described below. This does not mean the script is guaranteed to not work on other Unix-like systems or issues specific to those systems will not be addressed, merely it is unknown how well supported the script is on other Unix-like systems.

tspreed attempts to comply with [IEEE Std 1003.1-2001](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/) (a.k.a. SUSv3 or POSIX.1-2001) in order to be portable across Unix-like systems. However, **the script must utilize at least one of the below non-compliant features or commands** and will exit with an error if none are supported:

* `date(1)` - Can return nanoseconds via the '%N' format.
* `sleep(1)` - Supports the use of fractional values for the time operand to represent units of time less than 1 second.
* `usleep(1)`

The script utilizes terminal capabilities via `tput(1)`, but will fall back to the following where possible if those capabilities fail:

* [ANSI X3.64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) escape codes for terminal styling and cursor movement.
* `$COLUMNS` and `$LINES` environment variables for determining terminal size. Will fall back to 80 columns and/or 24 lines if one or both of the environmental variables are not defined.
